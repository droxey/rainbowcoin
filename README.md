## OpenSeaCreatures ERC721 contracts

### About OpenSeaCreatures.

This is a very simple sample ERC721 for the purposes of demonstrating integration with the [OpenSea](https://opensea.io) marketplace. We include a script for minting the items.

Additionally, this contract whitelists the proxy accounts of OpenSea users so that they are automatically able to trade the ERC721 item on OpenSea (without having to pay gas for an additional approval). On OpenSea, each user has a "proxy" account that they control, and is ultimately called by the exchange contracts to trade their items. (Note that this addition does not mean that OpenSea itself has access to the items, simply that the users can list them more easily if they wish to do so)

## Requirements

### Node version

Either make sure you're running a version of node compliant with the `engines` requirement in `package.json`, or install Node Version Manager [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and run `nvm use` to use the correct version of node.

## Installation

Run
```bash
npm install
```

If you run into an error while building the dependencies and you're on a Mac, run the code below, remove your `node_modules` folder, and do a fresh `npm install`:

```bash
xcode-select --install # Install Command Line Tools if you haven't already.
sudo xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools # Enable command line tools
sudo npm explore npm -g -- npm install node-gyp@latest # Update node-gyp
```

## Deploying

### Deploying to the Rinkeby network.

1. You'll need to sign up for [Infura](https://infura.io). and get an API key.
2. Using your API key and the mnemonic for your Metamask wallet (make sure you're using a Metamask seed phrase that you're comfortable using for testing purposes), run:

```
export INFURA_KEY="<infura_key>"
export MNEMONIC="<metmask_mnemonic>"
truffle deploy --network rinkeby
```

### Minting tokens.

After deploying to the Rinkeby network, there will be a contract on Rinkeby that will be viewable on [Rinkeby Etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io). For example, here is a [recently deployed contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xeba05c5521a3b81e23d15ae9b2d07524bc453561). You should set this contract address and the address of your Metamask account as environment variables when running the minting script:

```
export OWNER_ADDRESS="<my_address>"
export NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="<deployed_contract_address>"
export NETWORK="rinkeby"
node scripts/mint.js
```
